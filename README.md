This repository contains the MATLAB codes used to generate all numerical results and figures in the report *“Kink Dynamics: Kinks in Higher Dimensions”*. The project investigates the extension of one–dimensional kinks to higher dimensions, their interpretation as domain walls, the topological structure of magnetic skyrmions, and the scaling of their energy with dimension.
