This repository contains the MATLAB codes used to generate all numerical results and figures in the report *“Kink Dynamics: Kinks in Higher Dimensions”* by Max Shepherd. The project investigates the extension of one-dimensional kinks to higher spatial dimensions, their interpretation as domain walls, the topological structure of magnetic skyrmions and the scaling of their energy with spatial dimension.
